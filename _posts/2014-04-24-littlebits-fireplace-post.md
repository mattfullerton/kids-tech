This is a great little project from the introductory book that comes with the littleBits premium kit. Even really small children can rip up bits of coloured tissue paper. Attaching them in a suitable place such that they get enough airflow and don't get in the way of the fan blades was a bit more challenging though. To make it look a bit less like a bizarre collection of electronics bits, my daughter and I surrounded the "fire" with wooden blocks. Maybe the video will help keep you warm on a cold night.
